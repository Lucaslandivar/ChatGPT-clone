<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>It all started in my name generator project, where I investigated how to improve the project and it turned out that I could integrate an openai API, i.e. a ChatGPT API to use artificial intelligence to generate better names based on the user's description.
I became interested in the topic of an artificial intelligence API integration in my projects. I had never implemented an API before in any project, so I decided to start with this project. I carried out this project in html, css and javascript, where I was able to take advantage of my previous knowledge to make the project, how to save the chat in the browser (I learned this with my to-do list and Quiz App projects), eliminate the chat (I learned this with my to-do list project), changing the project's theme between light and dark (I learned this with my dashboard project and almost most), at the same time I learned how to integrate an API and more json.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can learn how to implement an API and how to make a chat project.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>To use the project is simple, just write "hello lucas" and present your doubts or questions, same scheme as ChatGPT, just don't put "hello" because it will generate a random text (I don't know why, but I've done everything to fixed that error but it didn't work).</p>
